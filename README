ZMQ Reactor C++ library.
Provides implementation of Reactor pattern for ZMQ library.
Supports three different kinds of reactors:
* static
* dynamic
* libevent
Static reactor is fast, as it's handlers are bound to sockets positions at compile-time, and no runtime overhead for dispatching occurs. But all the functions must be defined at compile time.
Dynamic reactor is more flexible, it allows add/remove handlers of any type at runtime, but it imposes runtime overhead of dynamic memory allocation on adding the handler, and a virtual call on handler's invocation.
LibEvent based reactor uses libevent's event loop, not zeroMQ built-in poll mechanism. It supports timeouts, enabling/disabling handlers. It relies oninternal usage of epoll via libevent).
